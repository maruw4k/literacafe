Can you lower the price for the website? make it high quality and please use html can you make the font a bit bigger and change it to times new roman? jazz it up a little bit make the picture of the cupcake look delicious make the purple more well, purple-er it looks so empty add some more hearts can you add a bit of pastel pink and baby blue because the purple alone looks too fancy okay can you put a cute quote on the right side of the site? oh no it looks messed up! i think we need to start from scratch. Can it be more retro can you make pink a little more pinkish. I know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version what is a hamburger menu, can you make it look more designed . You can get my logo from facebook theres all this spanish text on my site can you punch up the fun level on these icons you are lucky to even be doing this for us, for that will be a conversation piece we are a startup, thanks for taking the time to make the website, but i already made it in wix. Mmm, exactly like that, but different the flier should feel like a warm handshake can you make the font bigger? labrador you are lucky to even be doing this for us.
